<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT --> 
## About The Project :brain:
<h3>QR Code converter started off with a Node.js application that runs with NPM to inquire an url and save your url in .txt and generate a qr .png</h3> <b>stored in server-side directory</b> <br>
<br>
<h3>I have decided to create a client-side version using <b>bulma and vanilla js</b> which I want to work with other css framework such as bulma</h3>


### Built With :hammer_and_wrench:
* Vanilla Javascript - No framework used
* <a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express.js</a> - backend framework for node.js
* <a href="https://nodejs.org/en">Node.js</a> - Javascript runtime environment
* <a href="https://bulma.io/">Bulma.io</a> - CSS framework that is has a set of responsive mobile-first front-end template
* <a href="https://ionic.io/ionicons">ionicons</a> -  icon libraries
